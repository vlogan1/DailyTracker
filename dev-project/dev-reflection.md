How did you interpret and implement someone elseâ€™s idea?
I tried to show the exact same thing the PM provide in the wireframe of the webpage. He didn't ask to apply any colorful template, so I assume to make the design simple with black and white (it looks good too). Also pm had provided some references from other websites, and I just incorporate a simple bar chart.

What were the challenges in development and collaboration?
I found out the project he wants require a lot of knowledge of javascript. While developing the web page, I need to learn a lot of new things such as store data at local storage and creates a bar chart of historical data.

Which parts did you use AI tools for, and what did you learn from that?
I mostly used AI for js parts and I learned how to store data at local storage, create a bar chart of data, and create a div or button in js.
