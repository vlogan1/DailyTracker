How did you come up with your idea?
    
    I had seen people post daily trackers for various things online (see examples in prd), and I thought it would be cool to have a tool that let someone make a similar tracker for whatever they wanted.

How well did the collaboration with your developer work?

    Collaboration went very well using github issues!

What did you learn about writing requirements?

    Outlining a website in terms of 'user can...' 'user should be able to...' was not something I had thought about before. I hope that I provided a level of detail that adequately supported my dev! One thing I completely neglected to include in my prd was any guidance on aesthetics. I don't know if this was helpful or challening for my dev, but if I were to do this again I would definitely include some as that seems like a pretty big hole in the requirements I prodived.

Did you use any AI tools in this process? How?

    I initally used chatgpt to brainstorm some ideas that fit within the scale of the project, but the idea I ended up going with was not suggested by chatgpt. I think it helped me to get past the 'blank page problem' and start thinking about ideas that fit the scale of this project.
