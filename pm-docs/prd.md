Daily Visual Tracker

Inspired by a daily mood tracker, this website allows the user to track a personalized topic of their choice daily, and presents the user's recorded data visually.

Core Features:
-User is able to define a custom topic they want to track (ex. mood, weather, sleep quality, etc.) and the 'levels' each day can be recorded as within that topic (ex. happy, sad, angry, etc.). User should be able to define as many topics as they want.
-User is able to record the level for the current day for each of their topics. This response is stored for later.
-User can see their response history for each of their topics represented visually. User should be able to filter their history, such as viewing responses for the past year, month, week, etc..
*Bonus: User is able to define custom colors or emojis for each response level which appear in the visual history.
*Bonus: Additional information about user history is available, such as the distribution of response levels over the selected time period (ex. happy 53%, sad 18%, angry 5%, etc.)

Intended Pages:
-Homepage/landing page
-Create topic page
